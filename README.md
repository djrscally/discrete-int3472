# discrete-int3472
ACPI driver for discrete type INT3472 ACPI devices. These are dummy ACPI devices that expose GPIO lines intended to be used by sensor devices, in DSDT tables for platforms designed for windows. This driver maps those lines into regulators and gpios to be consumed by the sensor via the usual frameworks.
